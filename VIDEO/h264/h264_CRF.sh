	  # it should look the same or nearly the same as the input 
	  # but it isn't technically lossless.

      # The range is exponential, 
      # so increasing the CRF value +6 is roughly half the bitrate 
      # while -6 is roughly twice the bitrate. 
      # General usage is to choose the highest CRF value that 
      # still provides an acceptable quality. If the output looks good, 
      # then try a higher value and if it looks bad then choose a lower value.
